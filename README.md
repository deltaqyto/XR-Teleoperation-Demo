# XR-Teleoperation-Demo
A unity based teleoperation system tailored for UR3e pick and place manipulation
                                                                           
# Files of interest:
1. scripts/node_class_demo.py (must run start_orchestrator first) -> demos how to use the remote comms system to send and recieve data
2. Orchestrator/gui_node_settings_window.py (run standalone) -> demos the GUI settings and commands widgets

# Notes
You just need the LocalNode folder in your project to use the GUI and discovery system.
The remaining code is used to run the discovery and gui services.
